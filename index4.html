      <h1>Travelling in Depression</h1>
      
      <p>
        
    When I was very little, I caught the travel bug. It started after my grandparents first brought me to their home in
    France and I have now been to twentynine different countries. Each has given me a unique learning experience.<br>

    At five, I marveled at the Eiffel Tower in the City of Lights. When I was eight, I stood in the heart of Piazza San Marco

  to me as it made speech and comprehension more fluid, and even today I find
  that cognates come to the rescue when I forget how to say something in
  Spanish.<br></br> Then, in high school, I developed an enthusiasm for Chinese. As I studied
  combining simpler characters, so Huǒ (火) meaning fire and Shān (山) meaning
  Chinese at my school, I marveled how if just one stroke was missing from a
  character,the meaning is ost. I loved how long words were formed by
  mountain can be joined to create Huǒshān (火山), which means vocano. I love
  spending hours at a time practicing the characters and I can feel the beauty and rhythm as I form them.
